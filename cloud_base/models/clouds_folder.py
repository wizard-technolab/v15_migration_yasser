         (a) rule client is more important than own; if a rule does not have a client, folder should not also have it 
         (b) parent client is more importat than own client
        The method is hierarcically recursive
        IMPORTANT: it is critical to order self hierarhicly to calculate firtsly the parents and only then - children 
                   order of folders is *NOT* regulated by parent 

        Extra info:
         * actually the order of parent_client_id & rule_client id is not important, since rules have the same
           recursion logic, whilerule-related folders cannot be children to not rule-related ones. 
           However, for emergent cases it is preferable to apply the parent rule first, since it migth be also
           rule-related
         * manual folders within rule-related folders however might be moved to another parent and might be changed,
           so, in case parent folder does not have a client, it might be synced to any
         * clear_caches does not fully guarantee recursive update so we apply inverse on own_client_id and rule 
           client_id, which also serve for cleaning own_client_id when parent folder is cleared

            c. Odoo Object <> Object-related folder has a one2one2 relation. There might be not a few folders for the 
               same Odoo object. It is placed to the parent which order is the highest (recursively)

        In such a way, the relation object-related folder > model-related folder is always the kept (John > Tasks)
        The relation model-related folder > object-related  folder is not kept (Contacts > John)

        The very special case of folders is linked to Odoo Enterprise Documents. Such directories should not be taken
        into account here. It is managed in the add-on by the method _reconcile_folder_enterprise
        However, the very parent sync-model related folders for Enterprise directories are reconciled also there

        Args:
         * vals - dict of folder values
         * reconcilled_ids - list of folders we previously managed (so no need to write on that)
