    Important client peculiarities
    ------------------------------
    1. * Acessing by cloud_key (client ID) * 
       Google Drive, OneDrive allows full access for any item by IP and for all its operations
       DropBox mainly relies on paths, however instead of path for the most requests it is possible to pass ID with
       equal result
       Owncloud, Nextcloud rely strictly on paths, altough IDs are presented. So, to make a safe API call it is
       necessary to construct the whole tree if items (which have keys) and get path by that key

    2. * Listing children. Constructing the full tree of items instead of applying to each folder *
       Owncloud, Nextcloud, Dropbox allow making recursive children_get request. So, it is possible to construct
       the whole tree at the very moment of client initiating
       Google Drive, OneDrive do not allow that (seems because a single item might have a few parents)
       So, it is not possible to optimize performace for snapshots checks for all clients by replacing all snapshot
       children_get response with a single client request. Besides, it might be quite risky since assumes passing in 
       context hundreed of thousands (or even millions) items' dict.
       That's why it is decided to make general approach to get children per folder - with only exclusion of 
       Owncloud and Nextcloud, since they do not have capabilities for that.

        up-to-date

         * f1 > f2 > f3, ...: do the last tast since initial folder (f1) is taken from attachment while
           preparing (not from the active snapshot). Thus, preparing tasks would generate all moves f1 > f2; f1 > f3; .. 
           During *optimizing queue* we delete all ones except the last
         * f1 > f2 > f1: do nothing, since folder is eventually the same (and such a task should be archived during 
           optimizing clouds queue). In such a way, recursive blocking within the same folder would not take place,
           and we can safely leave move tasks as the most prioritized

         * f1 client 1 > f2 no client: get attachment back without uploading
         * f1 no client > f2 client 1/2: just upload to f2. The scenario is covered by checking for cloud_key.
           Actully this scenario is possible only in the varian of f1 (reversed). If such case is detected
           during preparation: previous attachments tasks are archived and upload task is planned
