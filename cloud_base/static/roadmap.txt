===================
Under consideration
===================
File manager
------------
* multi drag&drop files to file manager kanban area
* drag&drop files to a target jstree folder
* file manager previewer + sliding
* portal views + sharing (share folder, share selected attachments; downloading from portal)


Sync queue
----------
* combining both crons in a single process to avoid any probability of concurrency (seems bad for performance though)
* optimizing folders queue preparation: not to consider long ago deactivated folders
* when failed task is deleted because of attempts number > adapt child tasks to avoid their further fullfilment

Cloud clients
-----------------
* Amazon S3: introduce
* Box: introduce
* Onedrive/Sharepoint: consider switching to more contemporary lib 
  (e.g. https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python-core)

Misc
----
* add help notes to cloud clients & cloud rules
* generating Odoo dumps ans sync to target clients

Known Issues
============
* [Not controlled by the app] Google Drive frequently revoked token: Token from refresh token response: {'error': 
  'invalid_grant', 'error_description': 'Token has been expired or revoked.'}. 
  # Recommendations #: (a) get Google app approval; (b) manually reconnect
* [Not reproduced any more] Firefox Uncaught DOMException: The quota has been exceeded, when adding a new node to 
  jstree on the attachment box jstree.js 8011:
  set http://localhost:8014/cloud_base/static/lib/jstree/jstree.js:8011
    save_state http://localhost:8014/cloud_base/static/lib/jstree/jstree.js:7975
    to http://localhost:8014/cloud_base/static/lib/jstree/jstree.js:7948
    proxy http://localhost:8014/web/content/233-4ef885d/web.assets_common.js:2072
  # Recommendations #: (a) clear browser cache; (b) increase quota for FF
* [Not a bug; assumed bh] if folder is deleted because parent object is deleted > fhe folder would be still in clouds.
  # Recommendations #: (b) delete folder in clouds manually; 
* [Not a bug; assumed bh] Sync errors because of lack in storage
  # Recommendations #: (a) increase capacity or free space
